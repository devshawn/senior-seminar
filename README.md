# Senior Seminar

This is all of my work related to my computer science senior seminar at the University of Minnesota, Morris. This was completed in Spring 2017.

My senior seminar was on conflict-free vertex coloring of planar graphs. This is a variation of the classical vertex coloring problem. I also did a mathematics directed study and research on the vertex coloring problem, which can be found [here][vertex]. I like graph theory. I received distinction for both my paper and my presentation.

My final senior seminar files can be found here:
