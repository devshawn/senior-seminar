% This is a sample document using the University of Minnesota, Morris, Computer Science
% Senior Seminar modification of the ACM sig-alternate style. Much of this content is taken
% directly from the ACM sample document illustrating the use of the sig-alternate class. Certain
% parts that we never use have been removed to simplify the example, and a few additional
% components have been added.

% See https://github.com/UMM-CSci/Senior_seminar_templates for more info and to make
% suggestions and corrections.
