  annote = { Recent paper on two ordering heuristics for parallel greedy graph coloring. The authors prove their given heuristics do well in practice and apply each to another common parallel greedy algorithm. From a symposium with a low acceptance rate. The paper is pretty mathematically heavy, however. }

They propose an algorithm to obtain a chromatic number based on a given degree sequence of the vertices of a graph. From a symposium with a low acceptance rate. Likely to use as a primary source.}
