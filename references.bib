  annote = { Very recent paper on coloring planar graphs. It discusses conflict-free coloring of planar graphs which is slightly different than the typical vertex coloring problem. Not sure I'd use this, but it seemed like a well-written paper with a lot of results on planar graphs.}

  annote = { Provides the proof from 3-SAT to 3-COLOR to K-COLOR. I'd likely use this paper to discuss the NP-hardness for vertex coloring and how there are coloring problems that can be shown to be NP-complete and this paper gives good results on it.}

 annote = { Introductory graph theory book, has a great section on vertex coloring. Great for background information and includes a lot of the theorems regarding properties of coloring graphs. I didn't include a link as its a book and would only be used for background information. }
